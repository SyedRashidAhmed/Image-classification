# Image-classification
This project focuses on image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The dataset used for training and testing consists of two classes: "train" and "test," imported from Kaggle. It identifies whether the animal in the image is a cat or a dog, and provide accurate predictions.
To generate a README file and project description for GitHub based on the provided program, you can structure it as follows:

 Getting Started
To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. Setting Up Kaggle API Key:
   - Create a directory by running `!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle`.
   - Copy your Kaggle API key by executing `!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/`.

2. Importing Dataset:
   - Download the dataset using `!kaggle datasets download -d salader/dogs-vs-cats`.
   - Extract the dataset by unzipping the downloaded file.

3. Building the Model:
   - The model architecture includes Conv2D layers with BatchNormalization, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense layers with ReLU activation, Dropout layers, and a final Dense layer with sigmoid activation.
   - The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

4. Training and Validation:
   - The training and validation datasets are prepared using `image_dataset_from_directory`.
   - Image preprocessing involves normalization by dividing pixel values by 255.
   - The model is trained for 10 epochs with the specified datasets.

5. Model Evaluation:
   - Visualize the training and validation accuracy as well as loss using matplotlib.

6. Testing with New Images:
   - Load a test image (e.g., 'dogg.jpg') for prediction.
   - Resize and preprocess the image to match the model input shape.
   - Make predictions on the test image to classify it as a cat or dog.

Results
After training the model and evaluating its performance, it can accurately predict whether an input image contains a cat or a dog based on the learned features from the training data.

This README provides an overview of the project setup, model architecture, training process, evaluation metrics, and how to use the model for inference on new images.
