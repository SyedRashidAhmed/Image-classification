# Image-classification
This project focuses on image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The dataset used for training and testing consists of two classes: "train" and "test," imported from Kaggle. It identifies whether the animal in the image is a cat or a dog, and provide accurate predictions.
